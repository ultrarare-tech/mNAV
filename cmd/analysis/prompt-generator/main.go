	return `You are an expert financial analyst specializing in SEC filing analysis. Your task is to extract Bitcoin transaction information from the following SEC filing text.

FILING CONTEXT:
- Filing Type: %s
- Filing Date: %s
- Company: Public company filing with SEC
- Accession Number: %s

CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION RULES:

1. INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTIONS (EXTRACT THESE):
   - Announced on a SPECIFIC DATE with direct purchase language
   - Pattern: "On [specific date], [company] purchased/acquired [amount] bitcoins"
   - Examples:
     * "On August 11, 2020, MicroStrategy... has purchased 21,454 bitcoins"
     * "On December 4, 2020, MicroStrategy... had purchased approximately 2,574 bitcoins"
     * "On January 22, 2021, MicroStrategy... purchased approximately 314 bitcoins"
   - Key indicators: "On [date]", "announced that it had purchased", "announced that it purchased"

2. CUMULATIVE TOTALS (DO NOT EXTRACT):
   - Covers a DATE RANGE or PERIOD between two dates
   - Pattern: "during [period/quarter/time range between date1 and date2], purchased [amount] bitcoins"
   - Examples:
     * "during the period between July 1, 2021 and August 23, 2021, purchased 3,907 bitcoins"
     * "during the period between November 29, 2021 and December 8, 2021, purchased 1,434 bitcoins"
     * "During the period between November 1, 2022 and December 21, 2022, acquired 2,395 bitcoins"
   - Key indicators: "during the period between", "the period between X and Y", "during the quarter"

3. ADDITIONAL EXCLUSIONS:
   - Holdings updates ("As of [date], the Company holds X bitcoins")
   - Financing activities (bond offerings, loan proceeds, convertible notes)
   - Future intentions ("intends to invest", "will use proceeds", "may purchase")
   - Impairment charges or accounting adjustments

EXTRACTION RULES:
- ONLY extract transactions that follow the "On [specific date]" pattern
- IGNORE any transaction that mentions a date range or period
- For valid transactions, extract: BTC amount, USD amount, price per BTC, specific date
- Set confidence based on clarity of information (0.9 for clear individual transactions)

FILING TEXT:
%s

Please respond with a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "btc_amount": 0.0,
      "usd_amount": 0.0,
      "price_per_btc": 0.0,
      "transaction_type": "purchase|sale|transfer",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this is a valid INDIVIDUAL transaction (not cumulative)",
      "source_text": "Exact relevant excerpt from filing"
    }
  ],
  "analysis": "Overall analysis of Bitcoin-related content, noting any cumulative totals that were excluded",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "reasoning": "Overall reasoning for the extraction results, explaining individual vs cumulative classification"
}

If no INDIVIDUAL Bitcoin transactions are found (only cumulative totals), return an empty transactions array but still provide analysis explaining what cumulative data was found and excluded.`

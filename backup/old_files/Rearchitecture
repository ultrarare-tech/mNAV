Path 1: Modular Data Source Architecture with Plugin System
Overview: Create a flexible, extensible architecture that allows easy addition of new data sources and companies.
Key Changes:
-Data Source Interface System
-Create interfaces for different data providers (Bitcoin price, stock price, company holdings)
-Implement providers as plugins that can be swapped or combined
-Add fallback mechanisms when primary sources fail

Unified Data Model
-Create a central DataRepository that aggregates data from multiple sources
-Implement caching with TTL for different data types
-Add data validation and reconciliation between sources

Configuration-Driven Architecture
-Move from hardcoded scrapers to configuration-based data sources
-Support multiple data source configurations per company
-Add data source priority and fallback configurations
Benefits:
-Easy to add new data sources (APIs, scrapers, databases)
-Better reliability with fallback options
-Cleaner separation of concerns


Path 4: Data Quality and Analytics Focus
Overview: Enhance data accuracy and add advanced analytics capabilities.
Key Changes:
Data Quality Framework
Implement data validation rules and anomaly detection
Add data lineage tracking
Create reconciliation reports between sources
Advanced Metrics Engine
Build a flexible metric calculation framework
Add custom metric definitions via configuration
Implement backtesting capabilities
Historical Analysis Tools
Create time-series database integration
Add correlation analysis between companies
Build predictive models for mNAV trends
Benefits:
Higher data reliability
More sophisticated analysis capabilities
Better decision-making tools
Path 5: Microservices Architecture
Overview: Break down the monolith into focused microservices.
Key Services:
Data Ingestion Service
Handles all external data fetching
Manages rate limiting and retries
Publishes normalized data events
Calculation Service
Subscribes to data events
Performs all metric calculations
Caches results with intelligent invalidation
Storage Service
Manages all data persistence
Provides query APIs
Handles data archival and cleanup
API Gateway
Routes requests to appropriate services
Handles authentication and rate limiting
Aggregates responses from multiple services
Benefits:
Independent scaling of components
Technology flexibility per service
Easier team collaboration
Recommended Approach: Hybrid Path - Start with Path 1, Evolve to Path 3
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):
Implement data source interfaces
Create provider plugins for existing sources
Add configuration management
Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):
Build unified data repository
Add caching layer
Implement fallback mechanisms
Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6):
Create REST API endpoints
Refactor CLI to use API
Add authentication
Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8):
Implement GraphQL layer
Build web dashboard
Add real-time subscriptions
Quick Wins to Implement First:
Error Handling Improvements
Wrap all external calls with proper error types
Add structured logging with context
Implement retry policies consistently
Configuration Management
Use Viper for configuration
Support environment-specific configs
Add configuration validation
Testing Infrastructure
Add integration tests with mocked external services
Implement table-driven tests
Add benchmarks for critical paths
Code Organization
Move business logic out of CLI commands
Create proper service layers
Standardize error handling patterns
